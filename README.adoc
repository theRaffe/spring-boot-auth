# Spring Boot Authentication Example

This is a demonstration of a custom REST authentication API.
The app tries to add the CustomAuthenicationProvider to the
list of AuthenticationProviders, but Boot ignores it completely
and creates the UUID-password `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.

## Usage

Launch the application and execute the curl command below from a
terminal to test the login API call.

Expected behaviour is that the `CustomAuthenticationProvider` will
be used, so that the username/password `admin/admin` will work. Instead
Spring tries to use the default `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
